Data Model Query Language - Project  on "Enhancing Restaurant Operations with a Robust Database Management System"

Problem statement:
A restaurant database system addresses the challenge of effectively managing and organizing vast amounts of data
pertaining to restaurant operations, including menu items, cuisines, restaurant information, reviews, owner and financial
reporting. The system will serve as a centralized repository for all data and provide a streamlined approach to managing the
restaurant's various processes.
By implementing a restaurant database system, restaurants can reduce operational costs, enhance the customer experience, and make data-driven decisions to improve overall performance.
While Excel files have limitations in handling large data sets and conducting complex queries, database systems offer more advanced features for managing and querying data. These systems provide faster search and retrieval, support data analysis and reporting, and enable data sharing and collaboration. Furthermore, database systems allow for the creation of user roles and permissions to regulate access to sensitive data, and ensure data integrity and security through constraints and backups. In summary, a database system offers a more secure and efficient way to manage restaurant data compared to an Excel file.
